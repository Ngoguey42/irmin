(** {2 Profiling of Freeze}

    {3 Control Flow of the Freeze Thread}

    Most of the functions here should be called from under a single mutex lock. *)

val freeze_start : Mtime.t -> string -> unit
(** Signals the start of a new freeze given the time at which the freeze process
    started and the name given to the initial code section. *)

val freeze_section : string -> unit
(** Signals that the freeze is entering a specific section of the code. *)

val freeze_stop : unit -> unit
(** Signals the end of an ongoing freeze freeze. *)

val freeze_yield : unit -> unit
(** Signals that the freeze is cooperatively yielding to other threads. *)

val freeze_yield_end : unit -> unit
(** Signals that the freeze is given back the control. *)

(** {3 Incrementations of Counters} *)

val copy_contents : unit -> unit
(** Increments the number of copied contents for the current freeze. *)

val copy_nodes : unit -> unit
(** Increments the number of copied nodes for the current freeze. *)

val copy_commits : unit -> unit
(** Increments the number of copied commits for the current freeze. *)

val copy_branches : unit -> unit
(** Increments the number of copied branches for the current freeze. *)

val add : unit -> unit
(** Increment the number of objects added by main thread. *)

val skip : unit -> unit
(** Increment the number of skips during a graph traversal for the current
    freeze. *)

val copy_newies_loop : unit -> unit
(** Increment the number of iterations of newies copy. *)
